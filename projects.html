  <p>Above: Left image is the original insignia created for the Northwest Vista College Indigenous Awareness Group. This insignia has elements modeled after the sacred medicine wheel.
    Right image is the design displayed on the official promotional flyer for the event.<br><br>
    This project was closely supervised by the Indigenous Awareness Group comittee and was directly designed from their vision. The image of a turtle and the symbols emulating petroglyphs were a part of the design direction and process.
    This same insignia design was transferred onto a linoleum block for printmaking during the on-campus event.
